\section{}
Check the BIBO stability of each of the following transfer functions:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item $\frac{s-1}{s+1}$
    \item $\frac{s+1}{s(s+2)^2}$
    \item $\frac{s}{s^2+4}$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{}
The pole is at $s=-1$. The system is BIBO stable.

\subsection{}
The poles are at $s=0$ and $s=-2$. The system is not BIBO stable.

\subsection{}
The poles are at $s=0 \pm 2j$. The system is not BIBO stable.
